                    Hello, I'm Flimmy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I suppose the point of making this was to try motivate myself to spend my free time being more productive, by making things I consider  worth sharing, with the goal being to make the site have more ... stuff. It's not really meant to be a portfolio site or anything, more just like an internet space which just has little a bit of me on it.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I also want to begin writing blog-like stuff. I've never been a fan of blogging about my life on Twitter, it all feels mildly self centered to expect people to have any interest in reading about mundane activities of my life. I'm not sure what I will write about, chances are this site will just get abandoned and I will lose motivation to continue working on it, or I'll feel too cringe to blog, but I suppose  it is worth the try until then.
