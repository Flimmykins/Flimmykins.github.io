                Most of it is blender which I began learning in 2020, some of it is other stuff such as desktop and
                phone wallpapers<br>I put together.
                My hope in putting these here, is that having a place to put any creations will<br>
                make me feel more inclined to actually make and finish things for once.

                        <h2>Japanese Temple</h2>
                <p>This is my 5th scene, it is referenced from an artist I like, named <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/12411452">ショウイチ</a>. I wanted to see if I can try to make something more "anime"-esque in the shading and texturing, and I wanted it to be rendered entirely within Blender, opposed to using after-painting or anything. Overall I think it came out decent, It isn't entirely what I wanted but close enough. I hope to be able to make more anime-like environments but better in the future.</p><br>

                <p>This is my 4th scene, again more Japanese alleyway centric stuff, I like that aesthetic a lot. I still wanted to make it more realistic, but couldn't quite get the lighting down. That said, I like how it turned out. There's way more I want to add or improve, but I feel like I'd be stuck in a loop of constantly trying to improve things instead of just letting it be done and moving onto a new scene.</p><br>

                        <h2>Tesla</h2>
                <p>This was my first attempt really properly trying to model something with more complexity, opposed to more basic props for scenes.There's a few issues and things look a bit wobbly in places, but I'm really happy with how it turned out, completing this kind of gives me more confidence that I can try making more complex models at some point.</p><br>

                <p>This was the third scene I made, it's a 1980's styled diner. I didn't finish this scene because I wasn't good enough to really model the rest of the things I wanted to add at the time, maybe I'll finish it some time.</p><br>

                <p>This was my second attempt, and another Japanese centric backstreet. I think my modelling had improved, however I was trying to make a realistic scene, but quickly realized I couldn't. Good lighting is much harder than I expected, and overall I disliked the scene, so I stopped working on it.</p><br>

                <p>During the beginning of lockdown, I didn't really have anything to spend my time on, so I decided to try to learn 3D modelling. I really like Japanese architecture, and alleyways in particular, so this was the first thing I created. I maybe should have begun on something easier, but I was mostly happy with how I did.</p><br>
